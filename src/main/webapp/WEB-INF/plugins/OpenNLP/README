This directory contains wrappers for the OpenNLP java-based tools for
sentence detection, tokenization, pos-tagging, chunking and parsing,
named-entity detection, and coreference. The tools use the Maxent
machine learning package.

The wrappers use the following libraries:

OpenNLP Java API from http://opennlp.sourceforge.net/
OpenNLP Tools from http://opennlp.sourceforge.net/
OpenNLP Maxent from http://maxent.sourceforge.net/
GNU Trove from http://trove4j.sourceforge.net/

All of the above libraries are redistributed here under the GNU Lesser
General Public License (LGPL) Version 2.1, a copy of which can be
found in the file LICENSE.

By default, the wrappers use models for English which can be found in
models/english directory. The models are copies of those in the "models"
module in the OpenNLP CVS repository at http://opennlp.cvs.sourceforge.net
These models have also been redistributed here under the GNU Lesser General
Public License (LGPL) Version 2.1, a copy of which can be found in the file
LICENSE.


Thanks are due to Georgi D. Georgiev of Ontotext for wrapping the
OpenNLP tools for GATE, and to the OpenNLP project.
